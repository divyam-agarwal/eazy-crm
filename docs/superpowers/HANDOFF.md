# EasyCRM — Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-07-25 (P1a master data complete, on branch `p1a-master-data`, not yet merged)
**Purpose:** Everything a fresh agent needs to pick up this project and continue. Read this first, then the linked docs.

---

## 1. What this project is

**EasyCRM** — a multi-tenant SaaS CRM for Indian tier-2/3 **distributors, traders, and small manufacturers**. React (frontend, not started) + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. It is a real product intended to be sold.

- **Wedge:** enquiry → GST quotation → order. Stops hard at the Order (no invoicing/stock/ledger — that's Tally's job, and every target customer already runs Tally).
- **Positioning:** vertical-first (distributors/traders), not a horizontal Zoho clone.
- Full rationale is in the design spec (below). Read it before making product decisions.

## 2. Read these, in order

All under `docs/superpowers/`:

1. **`../../CLAUDE.md`** (repo root) — working agreements loaded every session. **Non-negotiable rules live here.**
2. **`specs/2026-07-22-easycrm-design.md`** — the full design spec (architecture, domain model, 4-layer isolation, import module, frontend plan, release plan). The source of truth for *what* to build.
3. **`plans/2026-07-24-p0-tenant-isolation-foundation.md`** — P0 isolation plan (DONE, merged).
4. **`plans/2026-07-25-p0-auth-core.md`** — P0-auth plan (**DONE, merged** — see §4 for what changed vs the plan).
5. **`specs/2026-07-25-p1a-master-data-design.md`** — P1a design spec (product/customer/contact/price-list master data). The source of truth for *what* P1a built.
6. **`plans/2026-07-25-p1a-master-data.md`** — P1a implementation plan (**DONE**, branch `p1a-master-data` — see §4 for execution-time deviations).
7. **`engineering-challenges.md`** — running log of non-obvious problems + solutions (15 entries). Great context on the stack's quirks.
8. **`annotations-reference.md`** — living glossary of every Spring/JPA annotation used.

## 3. Current state

- **Branch:** `p1a-master-data`, checked out off `main`. Not yet merged — next step is `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`. Repo is local-only (no git remote).
- **Merged & done on `main`:** the design docs + **P0 tenant-isolation foundation** + **P0-auth core** (both merge commits on `main`).
- **Complete but not yet merged:** **P1a master data** (product/customer/contact/price-list CRUD) on `p1a-master-data`, 14 tasks (13 planned + Task 7b added mid-execution, see §4). **83 tests passing** from a clean build (`cd backend && ./gradlew clean test`), up from 50 at the P0-auth baseline.
- **What P1a delivered:** tenant-scoped REST CRUD for `Product`, `Customer` (+ GSTIN checksum validation and GST-state-code derivation via the new `platform.gst.Gstin`/`StateCode` value types), `Contact` (nested under customer), `PriceList`, and `PriceListItem` (override-rate/discount-percent mutually-exclusive pricing). New shared plumbing: `platform.error.ValidationException` → 422 with field errors, `platform.web.PageResponse` (offset-paginated list envelope). Cross-tenant reads return 404 (not 403/200), matching the P0 pattern. Lives under `com.easycrm.catalog` and `com.easycrm.crm`.
- **What P0-auth delivered:** self-serve auth on top of the isolation foundation — atomic signup (tenant + first OWNER in one transaction), bcrypt login, rotating opaque JWT refresh tokens (SHA-256 at rest), tenant-scoped audit log, public auth endpoints with generic 401s. Lives under `com.easycrm.iam` (+ `platform.persistence.UuidV7`, `platform.error.{Conflict,Unauthorized}Exception`). Working `signup → login → GET /api/v1/auth/me → refresh` loop, all verified against Postgres + RLS.
- **What P0 (isolation) delivered:** the 4-layer multi-tenant isolation, all provably enforced by tests:
  1. **JWT resolution** (`platform/security` — `JwtService`, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `SecurityConfig`)
  2. **Hibernate `@TenantId`** (`platform/tenancy` — `TenantIdentifierResolver`, `HibernateTenancyConfig`; `TenantScopedEntity`)
  3. **Postgres RLS** (`TenantAwareTransactionManager` sets `app.current_tenant` per transaction; policies use `NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_tenant', true), '')::uuid`)
  4. **ArchUnit** (`arch/TenantScopingArchTest` — every `@Entity` must extend `TenantScopedEntity` unless allowlisted in `GLOBAL_TABLES`)
  - Plus: `BaseEntity` (UUIDv7 ids, auditing, `@Version`), `TenantContext` (ThreadLocal + `runAs`), `TenantAwareTaskDecorator` (async propagation), `Tenant` (global entity), `DemoRecord` (isolation test subject — throwaway, replaced by real entities later), 404-not-403 error mapping, `DemoSeeder` + `backend/DEMO.md`.

## 4. THE NEXT TASK

**P1a master data is DONE** (branch `p1a-master-data`, not yet merged — run `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to decide merge/PR). After that, pick the next chunk with the user (see §8): **P1b** (quotation engine — price resolution, money-as-JSON-string wire format, the actual GST quote/order flow) is the natural next step since it reads the master data P1a just built; the **P0-auth follow-up** (invitations + visibility layer + rate limiting) is still open too. Each goes: (spec →) writing-plans → executing-plans → finishing-a-development-branch.

### What P1a changed vs its plan (read before extending master data)

Two things happened mid-execution that weren't in `plans/2026-07-25-p1a-master-data.md` verbatim:

- **Task 7b (added, not originally planned): a global `@ExceptionHandler(DataIntegrityViolationException.class)` in `ApiExceptionHandler`.** The plan's per-entity services already do an app-level "does this already exist?" pre-check before insert (e.g. duplicate GSTIN, duplicate SKU) and throw `ConflictException` → 409. That pre-check is a check-then-act race, not a guarantee: two concurrent creates can both pass it, and the update path has no pre-check at all. Added a global handler that catches the DB unique-constraint violation itself and still returns 409 (generic message) instead of a raw 500 — the backstop that makes the uniqueness guarantee hold under concurrency and on update. Logged as challenge #15.
- **Task 9 deviation: `ContactRequest.isPrimary` boxed from primitive `boolean` to `Boolean`.** Jackson 3 (Boot 4) fails a request body that omits a primitive field with a 400 before the controller ever runs — there's no way for a primitive to represent "absent." Boxed to `Boolean`, defaulted explicitly in `ContactService` (`Boolean.TRUE.equals(...)`). Logged as challenge #12.

Also logged from P1a's core design (not deviations, just the two hardest correctness problems it solved): the GSTIN Luhn-mod-36 checksum (challenge #13) and the override-rate/discount-percent XOR + `BigDecimal.compareTo`-not-`equals` (challenge #14).

**Deferred to P1b** (explicit, from the P1a plan's Global Constraints — do not assume these exist yet):
- **Money-as-JSON-string wire format.** P1a is the first code to put a `BigDecimal` on the wire (`Product.gstRate/baseRate`, `PriceListItem.overrideRate/discountPct`, etc.) and it currently serializes as a plain JSON **number**, not the string format challenge #2 specifies (`WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN` + string). P1b must add the global Jackson-3/Boot-4 serializer customizer before the quotation wire contract and frontend money handling ship — otherwise JS's `double` re-introduces the rounding error challenge #2 exists to prevent.
- **Price resolution** (customer + product → effective rate, reading `PriceList`/`PriceListItem`). Entities exist; no resolver yet.
- **Record-level visibility filtering** on `customer.assigned_to`. Column exists; nothing currently filters reads by it — every user in a tenant can read every customer in that tenant.
- **Cursor pagination.** P1a's list endpoints use offset-based `Pageable`/`PageResponse`; large tables will need cursor pagination later.

### What P0-auth changed vs its plan (read before extending auth)

Two design points in `plans/2026-07-25-p0-auth-core.md` did not survive contact with the stack and were changed (all logged in `engineering-challenges.md` #8–#11):

- **No `TenantBinder`.** The plan's Task 7 rebound an *open* transaction to a new tenant mid-flight. That can't work: Hibernate resolves a session's tenant **once, at session-open**, and never re-reads it — so `@TenantId` kept writing the wrong tenant and the owner insert failed RLS `WITH CHECK`. **Instead:** `Tenant` carries an **application-assigned UUIDv7 id** (`platform.persistence.UuidV7`, and `Tenant` implements `Persistable` so `save()` inserts), and signup sets the tenant context **before** the `TransactionTemplate` transaction opens. `AuthService.signup/login/refresh` all follow this "set context, then open the tx" shape rather than being `@Transactional` themselves. (#9)
- **RLS-scoped derived finders are `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`** (`UserRepository.findByEmail`, `AuditLogRepository.countByAction`). Spring Data doesn't wrap derived queries in a transaction by default, so without this the tenant GUC isn't set and RLS returns **zero rows** (fails safe, easy to miss). (#8)
- **`LOGIN_FAILED` audit uses `AuditService.recordIndependently` (`REQUIRES_NEW`)** so it survives the rollback caused by the 401 throw. Success-path audits stay on default propagation. (#11)
- **Jackson 3 gotcha:** Boot 4 ships Jackson under `tools.jackson`, not `com.fasterxml.jackson`. Tests extract JSON with jayway `JsonPath` to sidestep the mapper API. (#10)

**Design decisions locked** (don't relitigate): bcrypt (not Argon2), HS256 (not RS256), opaque refresh tokens hashed at rest, `refresh_token` is a *global* allowlisted table while `app_user`/`audit_log` are tenant-scoped, generic 401 (no enumeration).

## 5. Environment (macOS, already set up)

- **JDK 25** installed (`~/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-25.0.1`). Shell default is JDK 21, but the **Gradle toolchain uses 25** — do NOT change the shell default.
- **Gradle 9.6.1** (via Homebrew) — but always use the wrapper: `cd backend && ./gradlew ...`.
- **Docker** must be running (Testcontainers needs it). Start Docker Desktop: `open -a Docker`, then wait for `docker info` to succeed. Note: a user Postgres container (`langfuse-postgres-1`) runs on `localhost:5432` — leave it alone; Testcontainers uses its own random-port container.
- **Run tests:** `cd backend && ./gradlew test` (or `clean test` for a full run). Integration tests spin up one shared Postgres container (singleton pattern) — the suite runs in ~4s once the image is cached.
- **Sandbox note:** in this harness, network + Docker operations may need the Bash tool's sandbox disabled (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`). SDKMAN's reachability check is blocked by the sandbox even when network works.

## 6. Stack quirks already discovered (see challenges log for detail)

This is **Spring Boot 4.1 + Java 25 + Hibernate 7** — all recent. Watch for:
- **Spring Boot 4 split auto-config into per-integration modules.** `flyway-core` alone doesn't bring `FlywayAutoConfiguration` → use `spring-boot-starter-flyway`. `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` moved to `org.springframework.boot.webmvc.test.autoconfigure` (module `spring-boot-webmvc-test`). `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` moved to `org.springframework.boot.hibernate.autoconfigure`. **If an import "does not exist," search the resolved jars for the class's new package** rather than assuming the plan is wrong.
- **ArchUnit 1.4.1** (not 1.3.0) — 1.3.0 silently skips Java 25 bytecode.
- **Testcontainers BOM pinned to 1.21.3** (Boot 4 BOM doesn't manage those versions).
- **RLS + custom GUC:** a referenced custom GUC resets to `''` not NULL, so policies use `NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_tenant', true), '')::uuid`. An RLS `USING` clause also acts as `WITH CHECK` for inserts.
- **Two DB roles:** Flyway runs as the **owner** (Testcontainers superuser); the app connects as **`easycrm_app`** (non-owner, no BYPASSRLS) — this is what makes RLS real. `IntegrationTest` wires both datasources.
- **`ddl-auto: validate`** is on — migration column types must match entity mappings exactly (e.g. `VARCHAR` not `CHAR` for a `String`).

## 7. Working agreements (also in CLAUDE.md — enforced)

- **Commits:** author as `divyam <divyam.0444@gmail.com>` (repo git config is already set). Plain `git commit`. **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer or mention Claude/AI in commit messages.
- **Log engineering challenges:** when a task surfaces a non-obvious problem, append to `engineering-challenges.md` (Problem → why hard → Solution → Lesson) in the same change.
- **Keep the annotations reference current:** add a row when a new annotation appears.
- **TDD:** failing test → run-to-confirm-fail → minimal code → run-to-pass → commit. One task per commit.
- **Money is never `double`** (BigDecimal / NUMERIC / JSON string). P1a is the first module with `BigDecimal` fields (`Product.gstRate/baseRate`, `PriceListItem.overrideRate/discountPct`) and got the Java/Postgres side right (`NUMERIC`, `compareTo` not `equals`); the **JSON-string wire format is still outstanding** — see the P1b follow-ups in §4.
- **Tenant isolation is structural:** never hand-write `WHERE tenant_id`; rely on `@TenantId` + RLS; new entities extend `TenantScopedEntity` or get allowlisted (ArchUnit enforces).

## 8. After P1a

Options (confirm with the user): **P1b** (quotation engine on top of the P1a master data — price resolution, GST quote calc, money-as-JSON-string wire format), or the still-open **P0-auth follow-up** (invitations + visibility layer + rate limiting). Both are scoped in the spec. Each new chunk goes: (already-approved spec →) writing-plans → executing-plans → finishing-a-development-branch.
