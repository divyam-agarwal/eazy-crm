# EasyCRM — Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27 (enquiry slice merged to `main` as `a68035d`; order/accept merged as `ea11d3f`)
**Purpose:** Everything a fresh agent needs to pick up this project and continue. Read this first, then the linked docs.

---

## 1. What this project is

**EasyCRM** — a multi-tenant SaaS CRM for Indian tier-2/3 **distributors, traders, and small manufacturers**. React (frontend, not started) + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. It is a real product intended to be sold.

- **Wedge:** enquiry → GST quotation → order. Stops hard at the Order (no invoicing/stock/ledger — that's Tally's job, and every target customer already runs Tally).
- **Positioning:** vertical-first (distributors/traders), not a horizontal Zoho clone.
- Full rationale is in the design spec (below). Read it before making product decisions.

## 3. Current state

- **Branch:** `main`, working tree clean (enquiry slice merged; feature branch deleted).
- **Merged & done on `main`:** the design docs + **P0 tenant-isolation foundation** + **P0-auth core** + **P1a master data** (merge commit `2f9a2f4`) + **P1b quotation engine** (merge commit `43e9642`) + **order + accept** (merge commit `ea11d3f`) + **enquiry** (merge commit `a68035d`).
- **Latest merged: the enquiry slice** (7 tasks + a post-review re-enquiry test + PATCH-contract docs) on top of the sales module. **154 tests passing** from a clean build (`cd backend && ./gradlew clean test`), up from the 132 order/accept baseline.
- **Enquiry scope:** the wedge's *head* (lead capture) — 7 tasks (phone normalizer, the `Enquiry` aggregate + guarded 5-stage lifecycle, migration/RLS/partial-index dedupe, create endpoint, get + filtered list via a JPA `Specification`, edit/advance/lose transitions, and this challenges/annotations/handoff wrap-up).
- **What enquiry delivered:** the `Enquiry` aggregate (table `enquiry` — not reserved; tenant-scoped, RLS-covered) carrying nullable `customerId` (walk-ins), raw contact fields (`contactName`, `contactPhone` + derived `normalizedPhone`, `contactEmail`), `source` (own `EnquirySource` enum — same six values as `crm.CustomerSource`, kept separate so `sales` stays decoupled), `requirementText`, `assignedTo`, `stage` (`EnquiryStage`), optional `expectedValue` (money, JSON-string wire), and `lostReason`. **5-stage guarded lifecycle** `NEW → CONTACTED → QUALIFIED → CONVERTED / LOST`: guards live in the entity (mirroring `Quotation`'s transition methods), `advanceTo` allows only a later *active* stage (skips ok, no backward/terminal-target), `lose` requires a reason, `markConverted()` exists but is **reserved for the later conversion slice — no controller reaches it yet** (so in this slice a phone is freed for re-enquiry only via `LOST`). **Dedupe = one active enquiry per phone**, enforced structurally by a Postgres **partial unique index** `UNIQUE(tenant_id, normalized_phone) WHERE stage NOT IN ('CONVERTED','LOST')` plus an app-level active-only pre-check (→409) with the challenge #15 `DataIntegrityViolation`→409 backstop (challenge #23). **List** uses a JPA `Specification` that AND-composes any subset of `?stage=&assignedTo=&source=` — deliberately avoiding the order-list "drops a filter when two are supplied" bug (challenge #24). REST: `POST` (201), `GET /{id}` (cross-tenant 404), `GET` (filtered, offset `PageResponse`, cross-tenant empty), `PATCH /{id}` (active-only edit, re-dedupes on phone change), `POST /{id}/advance`, `POST /{id}/lose`. Lives under `com.easycrm.sales` (+ `.web`, `.web.dto`). Challenges #23–#24; no new annotations (`JpaSpecificationExecutor`/`Specification` noted in the annotations reference as concepts, not annotations).
- **P1a scope:** product/customer/contact/price-list CRUD — 13 planned tasks plus three execution-time additions (Task 7b global 409 handler, Task 13b test-hardening, and a final-review fix — see §4).
- **P1b scope:** the quotation engine on top of P1a's master data — 12 planned tasks (money-as-JSON-string wire format, GST calc, gapless document numbering, price resolution, the quotation/version/item aggregate + RLS, create/get/list/versions, edit with the frozen-version guard, send, revise, reject/expire, and its challenges/annotations/handoff wrap-up).
- **Order/accept scope:** the wedge's final stage on top of P1b — 7 tasks (the `Order` aggregate on physical table `sales_order`, gapless `ORD/FY/NNNN` numbering, the `accept` transition, `QuotationAcceptedEvent` + audit subscriber, order read endpoints, and this challenges/annotations/handoff wrap-up).
- **What order/accept delivered:** the `Order` aggregate — tenant-scoped, RLS-covered, physical table **`sales_order`** because `order` is a reserved SQL word (class stays `Order`, challenge #20) — carrying `orderNo`, `quotationId`/`quotationVersionId`, `customerId`, optional `poReference`/`poDate`, `subTotal`/`totalTax`/`grandTotal`, and `status` (currently only **`CONFIRMED`**; `DISPATCHED`/`CLOSED`/`CANCELLED` are deferred). Gapless per-tenant/per-FY order numbering (`ORD/FY/NNNN`) reuses `DocumentNumberService`/`document_counter` under a distinct `"ORDER"` counter key (challenge #16's pattern, second doc type). `QuotationService.accept(id, AcceptRequest)`: validates the quotation is `SENT`, creates the `Order` inline (so the HTTP response carries it immediately), flips the quotation to `ACCEPTED`, then publishes `QuotationAcceptedEvent` for decoupled subscribers — a deliberate deviation from the parent spec's "the order handler subscribes" wording, keeping the event as a side-effect seam rather than a return channel while preserving same-transaction atomicity (challenge #22). `OrderAcceptedAuditListener` (`@EventListener`, synchronous, same-transaction) writes the `QUOTATION_ACCEPTED` audit row. Idempotency is **natural/state-based**, not a client idempotency key: a re-accept of an already-`ACCEPTED` quotation returns the existing order (`OrderRepository.findByQuotationId`), backed by `UNIQUE(tenant_id, quotation_id)` on `sales_order` plus the quotation's inherited `@Version` optimistic lock for the raced case (challenge #21). Read endpoints: `GET /api/v1/orders/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/orders` (status/customerId filters, offset-paginated `PageResponse`, cross-tenant → 404). Lives under `com.easycrm.sales` (+ `.web`, `.web.dto`).
- **What P1b delivered:** the `Quotation`/`QuotationVersion`/`QuotationItem` aggregate (tenant-scoped, RLS-covered); a price resolver (customer + product → effective rate off `PriceList`/`PriceListItem`, falling back to `Product.baseRate`); server-side GST calc (per-line round-then-sum, intra-state CGST+SGST vs inter-state IGST, keyed off `Tenant.state_code` vs the customer's GSTIN-derived state); gapless per-tenant/per-FY document numbering (`document_counter` + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, see challenge #16); the global `BigDecimal`-as-JSON-string wire format for money (challenge #17, also retroactively fixing P1a's money fields); and the full lifecycle — create → edit (header patch / full item replace, guarded to DRAFT only) → send (freezes the version, assigns the quote number) → revise (spawns a new DRAFT version copying the frozen items verbatim) → reject/expire (challenge #18). Lives under `com.easycrm.sales` (+ `platform.money.BigDecimalStringModule`).
- **What P1a delivered:** tenant-scoped REST CRUD for `Product`, `Customer` (+ GSTIN checksum validation and GST-state-code derivation via the new `platform.gst.Gstin`/`StateCode` value types), `Contact` (nested under customer), `PriceList`, and `PriceListItem` (override-rate/discount-percent mutually-exclusive pricing). New shared plumbing: `platform.error.ValidationException` → 422 with field errors, `platform.web.PageResponse` (offset-paginated list envelope). Cross-tenant reads return 404 (not 403/200), matching the P0 pattern. Lives under `com.easycrm.catalog` and `com.easycrm.crm`.
- **What P0-auth delivered:** self-serve auth on top of the isolation foundation — atomic signup (tenant + first OWNER in one transaction), bcrypt login, rotating opaque JWT refresh tokens (SHA-256 at rest), tenant-scoped audit log, public auth endpoints with generic 401s. Lives under `com.easycrm.iam` (+ `platform.persistence.UuidV7`, `platform.error.{Conflict,Unauthorized}Exception`). Working `signup → login → GET /api/v1/auth/me → refresh` loop, all verified against Postgres + RLS.
- **What P0 (isolation) delivered:** the 4-layer multi-tenant isolation, all provably enforced by tests:
  1. **JWT resolution** (`platform/security` — `JwtService`, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `SecurityConfig`)
  2. **Hibernate `@TenantId`** (`platform/tenancy` — `TenantIdentifierResolver`, `HibernateTenancyConfig`; `TenantScopedEntity`)
  3. **Postgres RLS** (`TenantAwareTransactionManager` sets `app.current_tenant` per transaction; policies use `NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_tenant', true), '')::uuid`)
  4. **ArchUnit** (`arch/TenantScopingArchTest` — every `@Entity` must extend `TenantScopedEntity` unless allowlisted in `GLOBAL_TABLES`)
  - Plus: `BaseEntity` (UUIDv7 ids, auditing, `@Version`), `TenantContext` (ThreadLocal + `runAs`), `TenantAwareTaskDecorator` (async propagation), `Tenant` (global entity), `DemoRecord` (isolation test subject — throwaway, replaced by real entities later), 404-not-403 error mapping, `DemoSeeder` + `backend/DEMO.md`.

## 4. THE NEXT TASK

**The enquiry slice is DONE and merged to `main` (`a68035d`).** All 7 tasks landed and reviewed, plus a post-final-review re-enquiry HTTP test and PATCH-contract docs; clean-build total is 154 tests, all green. Next step is to pick the next chunk with the user (see §8).

**Deferred out of enquiry scope** (explicit — do not assume any of this exists):
- **Enquiry → quotation conversion wiring** — `Enquiry.markConverted()` exists but no endpoint reaches it; nothing flips an enquiry to `CONVERTED` or stamps `quotation.enquiry_id` from an enquiry yet. `quotation.enquiry_id` remains a nullable forward-compat column. This is the natural next thin follow-up.
- **`activity` / `follow_up` entities** — the spec's Activity section (CALL/WHATSAPP/EMAIL/VISIT/NOTE logs + first-class follow-up reminders) is still unbuilt.
- **Order status transitions beyond `CONFIRMED`** — `OrderStatus` is a one-member enum today; `DISPATCHED`/`CLOSED`/`CANCELLED` and their transitions don't exist yet.
- **PDF generation** and the **`wa.me` WhatsApp share link** — no rendering/sharing of a quotation or order exists yet.
- **Scheduled auto-expiry** — only a manual `expire` action exists on quotations; nothing runs on a schedule to expire quotations past `validUntil` automatically.
- **Record-level visibility filtering** — still open from P1a (§4 P1a notes); quotations, orders, and now enquiries inherit the same gap (every user in a tenant reads every enquiry in it).
- **Cursor pagination** — quotation, order, and enquiry list endpoints use the same offset-based `Pageable`/`PageResponse` as P1a; large tenants will need cursor pagination later.

**Testing note for anyone extending quotation flows:** quotation reads a real `Tenant.state_code` (to compute the intra-/inter-state GST split against the customer's GSTIN-derived state), so a phantom tenant — `TestTokens.owner(UUID.randomUUID())`, which mints a JWT for a tenant id that has no backing row — is **not enough** here, even though it's sufficient for RLS-only tables elsewhere in the codebase. Quotation tests use the new `TestTokens.provisionOwner(stateCode)`, which inserts a real `Tenant` row (with the given GST state code) before minting the token. Reach for `provisionOwner` whenever a test path reads anything off the `Tenant` row itself, not just whenever it needs *a* tenant id.

### What P1a changed vs its plan (read before extending master data)

Two things happened mid-execution that weren't in `plans/2026-07-25-p1a-master-data.md` verbatim:

- **Task 7b (added, not originally planned): a global `@ExceptionHandler(DataIntegrityViolationException.class)` in `ApiExceptionHandler`.** The plan's per-entity services already do an app-level "does this already exist?" pre-check before insert (e.g. duplicate GSTIN, duplicate SKU) and throw `ConflictException` → 409. That pre-check is a check-then-act race, not a guarantee: two concurrent creates can both pass it, and the update path has no pre-check at all. Added a global handler that catches the DB unique-constraint violation itself and still returns 409 (generic message) instead of a raw 500 — the backstop that makes the uniqueness guarantee hold under concurrency and on update. Logged as challenge #15.
- **Task 9 deviation: `ContactRequest.isPrimary` boxed from primitive `boolean` to `Boolean`.** Jackson 3 (Boot 4) fails a request body that omits a primitive field with a 400 before the controller ever runs — there's no way for a primitive to represent "absent." Boxed to `Boolean`, defaulted explicitly in `ContactService` (`Boolean.TRUE.equals(...)`). Logged as challenge #12.

Also logged from P1a's core design (not deviations, just the two hardest correctness problems it solved): the GSTIN Luhn-mod-36 checksum (challenge #13) and the override-rate/discount-percent XOR + `BigDecimal.compareTo`-not-`equals` (challenge #14).

**Deferred to P1b** (explicit, from the P1a plan's Global Constraints — do not assume these exist yet):
- **Money-as-JSON-string wire format.** P1a is the first code to put a `BigDecimal` on the wire (`Product.gstRate/baseRate`, `PriceListItem.overrideRate/discountPct`, etc.) and it currently serializes as a plain JSON **number**, not the string format challenge #2 specifies (`WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN` + string). P1b must add the global Jackson-3/Boot-4 serializer customizer before the quotation wire contract and frontend money handling ship — otherwise JS's `double` re-introduces the rounding error challenge #2 exists to prevent.
- **Price resolution** (customer + product → effective rate, reading `PriceList`/`PriceListItem`). Entities exist; no resolver yet.
- **Record-level visibility filtering** on `customer.assigned_to`. Column exists; nothing currently filters reads by it — every user in a tenant can read every customer in that tenant.
- **Cursor pagination.** P1a's list endpoints use offset-based `Pageable`/`PageResponse`; large tables will need cursor pagination later.

### What P0-auth changed vs its plan (read before extending auth)

Two design points in `plans/2026-07-25-p0-auth-core.md` did not survive contact with the stack and were changed (all logged in `engineering-challenges.md` #8–#11):

- **No `TenantBinder`.** The plan's Task 7 rebound an *open* transaction to a new tenant mid-flight. That can't work: Hibernate resolves a session's tenant **once, at session-open**, and never re-reads it — so `@TenantId` kept writing the wrong tenant and the owner insert failed RLS `WITH CHECK`. **Instead:** `Tenant` carries an **application-assigned UUIDv7 id** (`platform.persistence.UuidV7`, and `Tenant` implements `Persistable` so `save()` inserts), and signup sets the tenant context **before** the `TransactionTemplate` transaction opens. `AuthService.signup/login/refresh` all follow this "set context, then open the tx" shape rather than being `@Transactional` themselves. (#9)
- **RLS-scoped derived finders are `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`** (`UserRepository.findByEmail`, `AuditLogRepository.countByAction`). Spring Data doesn't wrap derived queries in a transaction by default, so without this the tenant GUC isn't set and RLS returns **zero rows** (fails safe, easy to miss). (#8)
- **`LOGIN_FAILED` audit uses `AuditService.recordIndependently` (`REQUIRES_NEW`)** so it survives the rollback caused by the 401 throw. Success-path audits stay on default propagation. (#11)
- **Jackson 3 gotcha:** Boot 4 ships Jackson under `tools.jackson`, not `com.fasterxml.jackson`. Tests extract JSON with jayway `JsonPath` to sidestep the mapper API. (#10)

**Design decisions locked** (don't relitigate): bcrypt (not Argon2), HS256 (not RS256), opaque refresh tokens hashed at rest, `refresh_token` is a *global* allowlisted table while `app_user`/`audit_log` are tenant-scoped, generic 401 (no enumeration).

## 5. Environment (macOS, already set up)

- **JDK 25** installed (`~/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-25.0.1`). Shell default is JDK 21, but the **Gradle toolchain uses 25** — do NOT change the shell default.
- **Gradle 9.6.1** (via Homebrew) — but always use the wrapper: `cd backend && ./gradlew ...`.
- **Docker** must be running (Testcontainers needs it). Start Docker Desktop: `open -a Docker`, then wait for `docker info` to succeed. Note: a user Postgres container (`langfuse-postgres-1`) runs on `localhost:5432` — leave it alone; Testcontainers uses its own random-port container.
- **Run tests:** `cd backend && ./gradlew test` (or `clean test` for a full run). Integration tests spin up one shared Postgres container (singleton pattern) — the suite runs in ~4s once the image is cached.
- **Sandbox note:** in this harness, network + Docker operations may need the Bash tool's sandbox disabled (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`). SDKMAN's reachability check is blocked by the sandbox even when network works.

## 6. Stack quirks already discovered (see challenges log for detail)

This is **Spring Boot 4.1 + Java 25 + Hibernate 7** — all recent. Watch for:
- **Spring Boot 4 split auto-config into per-integration modules.** `flyway-core` alone doesn't bring `FlywayAutoConfiguration` → use `spring-boot-starter-flyway`. `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` moved to `org.springframework.boot.webmvc.test.autoconfigure` (module `spring-boot-webmvc-test`). `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` moved to `org.springframework.boot.hibernate.autoconfigure`. **If an import "does not exist," search the resolved jars for the class's new package** rather than assuming the plan is wrong.
- **ArchUnit 1.4.1** (not 1.3.0) — 1.3.0 silently skips Java 25 bytecode.
- **Testcontainers BOM pinned to 1.21.3** (Boot 4 BOM doesn't manage those versions).
- **RLS + custom GUC:** a referenced custom GUC resets to `''` not NULL, so policies use `NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_tenant', true), '')::uuid`. An RLS `USING` clause also acts as `WITH CHECK` for inserts.
- **Two DB roles:** Flyway runs as the **owner** (Testcontainers superuser); the app connects as **`easycrm_app`** (non-owner, no BYPASSRLS) — this is what makes RLS real. `IntegrationTest` wires both datasources.
- **`ddl-auto: validate`** is on — migration column types must match entity mappings exactly (e.g. `VARCHAR` not `CHAR` for a `String`).

## 7. Working agreements (also in CLAUDE.md — enforced)

- **Commits:** author as `divyam <divyam.0444@gmail.com>` (repo git config is already set). Plain `git commit`. **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer or mention Claude/AI in commit messages.
- **Log engineering challenges:** when a task surfaces a non-obvious problem, append to `engineering-challenges.md` (Problem → why hard → Solution → Lesson) in the same change.
- **Keep the annotations reference current:** add a row when a new annotation appears.
- **TDD:** failing test → run-to-confirm-fail → minimal code → run-to-pass → commit. One task per commit.
- **Money is never `double`** (BigDecimal / NUMERIC / JSON string). P1a got the Java/Postgres side right (`NUMERIC`, `compareTo` not `equals`) but still shipped `BigDecimal` fields on the wire as plain JSON numbers; **P1b closed that gap globally** with `platform.money.BigDecimalStringModule` (challenge #17) — every `BigDecimal`, including P1a's already-shipped fields, now serializes as a JSON string.
- **Tenant isolation is structural:** never hand-write `WHERE tenant_id`; rely on `@TenantId` + RLS; new entities extend `TenantScopedEntity` or get allowlisted (ArchUnit enforces).

## 8. After enquiry

Once `enquiry-slice` is merged, options (confirm with the user): the **enquiry → quotation conversion** wiring (thin follow-up — flip the enquiry to `CONVERTED` and stamp `quotation.enquiry_id` when a quote is raised from a lead), **order status transitions** (`DISPATCHED`/`CLOSED`/`CANCELLED`), PDF + `wa.me` share for a quotation/order, scheduled auto-expiry, the **`activity`/`follow_up`** entities (the "never lose a follow-up" promise), or the still-open **P0-auth follow-up** (invitations + visibility layer + rate limiting). All are scoped in the spec. Each new chunk goes: (already-approved spec →) writing-plans → executing-plans → finishing-a-development-branch.
